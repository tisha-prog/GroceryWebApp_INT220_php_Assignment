# GroceryWebApp_INT220_php_Assignment

These days our world is moving pretty rapidly, so people are striving to find specific solutions which allow them to take care of certain day-to-day stuff, and thus making some spare time to deal with other more important things.
The thing is the features of grocery shopping list apps are highly appreciated by the audience since they allow drawing up lists to go food shopping, ordering grocery suppliers online, delivering foodstuff wherever required, in case a person canâ€™t pick it up at the grocery store, and much more.
